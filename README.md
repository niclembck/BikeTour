# BikeTour
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It uses React, Redux, and a variety of extensions such as Axios, React-Router, Lodash, Styled-Components and MapBox along with the Strava API.

It is meant as a proof of concept for an application to plan bike tours, giving the tourer a rough guide as well as the actual outcome of the tour to share with friends and loved ones. My hope with this application is to make the prospect of touring as smooth as possible for the tourer, while also providing information and comfort to those back at home.
